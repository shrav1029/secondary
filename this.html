                    The September 11 attacks, commonly known as 9/11,[d] were four coordinated suicide terrorist attacks carried out by the militant Islamic extremist network al-Qaeda[2][3][4] 
                    against the United States on Tuesday, September 11, 2001. That morning, nineteen terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners scheduled to travel from the northeastern U.S. to California. 
                    The hijackers crashed the first two planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, and the third plane into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the American military) 
                    in Arlington, Virginia. The fourth plane was intended to hit a federal government building[e] in Washington,
                    D.C., but crashed in a field following a passenger revolt.
                    [5] The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people and instigated the global war on terror.
